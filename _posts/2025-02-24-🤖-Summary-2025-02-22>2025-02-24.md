Over the past few days, the Umfeld project has undergone a significant refactor, particularly in its rendering architecture. The most notable change is the renaming of Renderer to PGraphicsOpenGLv33, aligning the naming convention with Processing’s PGraphics model and making it clearer that this is an OpenGL 3.3-based implementation. Alongside this, multiple improvements were introduced, including optimized texture loading, better vertex handling, and a cleaner shader structure. The rendering pipeline now supports stroke and fill operations separately, with dedicated buffer handling for each, improving efficiency and flexibility. Additionally, a new linse() method was introduced as an alias for line(), and various cleanup tasks were performed, including improved function naming and removing redundant code. These updates mark a step toward a more structured, Processing-like API while maintaining OpenGL 3.3 performance optimizations.
